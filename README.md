# Android Remote Inter Component Communication -- [ricci] reproducibility repository

This repository contains the RICCi code generator, code samples, energy readings, and collected metrics from the samples projects built both using RICCi and hand-written for the data exchange patterns copy, remote, and stream. 
    
 - RICCi demos are based on the PigeonMessanger project available at  https://github.com/deib-polimi/PigeonMessanger.
 - In order to run the demos, you will need to use two Android devices with WiFi capabilities, as the demos use WiFi direct to communicate.
 - This are the links to the publications:
